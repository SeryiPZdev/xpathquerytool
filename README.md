XPath Query Tool - Program to query over XML files with XPath
---------------------------------------------------------------
This program is designed to be able to query an XML with XPath. The return type must be indicated: Boolean, Number, String, Node, and Nodeset. In the case of Nodeset, a checkbox appears that allows you to see distinct values.

You can get the executable you need from: https://github.com/SeryiPZdev/xpathquerytool/tree/main/xpathquerytool-trunk/dist

There is a version for Windows x86, another for Windows x64 and the executable .jar for any other platform.
